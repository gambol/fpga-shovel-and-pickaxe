fpga-shovel-and-pickaxe
=======================

Open source bitcoin sha and litecoin scrypt verilog fpga miner implementation (pickaxe) + java stratum client and miner app (shovel). :)

Intent of this project is to develop fully opensource (apache) fpga scrypt and sha mining prototypes and possibly build ASIC devices from them.

There are also some simple and usable java source codes for interfacing stratum servers, just take a look. (they are described little bit more in the wiki.

Please visit project wiki pages, you can find all info there...
